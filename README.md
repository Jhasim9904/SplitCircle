# 💸 Expense & Budget Buddy — FastAPI + FastMCP

Smart Expense Buddy and Budget Tracker— Powered by FastAPI &amp; FastMCP for Agent-based Budget Management.

**Expense Buddy** is a practical **Model-Context-Protocol (MCP)** project that helps users **log expenses**, **manage budgets**, **visualize trends**, and **export expense logs as CSV**, all powered by **FastAPI**, **FastMCP**, and **Streamlit**, deployed fully serverless on **Render**.

## 🚀 **What It Solves**

Keeping track of everyday expenses manually is tedious — especially when you’re trying to stick to a weekly budget.  
**Expense Buddy** lets you:

- Log expenses with notes.
- Instantly see where your money goes with **weekly summaries**, top categories, and spending trends.
- Export all your logged expenses as a **CSV file** for easy backup or further analysis.
- **Reset** all data to start fresh anytime.
- Use **NLP-powered auto-categorization** — e.g., type "Rapido" and it’s smartly categorized as _Transportation_ which has been manually done for several most used keywords in our code.

This shows how an MCP pattern works in real life: the backend handles data processing, categorization, and storage, while the frontend focuses on user experience, visualization, and export.

## 🧩 **How It Works**

### ✅ **Backend (FastAPI + FastMCP)**

- Exposes endpoints like `/expense` and `/budget`.
- Uses **FastMCP** to modularize tasks like NLP category assignment.
- Stores data in a simple `expenses.json` file.

### ✅ **Frontend (Streamlit)**

- Lets users:
  - Set weekly budgets.
  - Log new expenses.
  - View weekly expense breakdowns & category trends.
  - **Export expense logs as a CSV** with one click.
  - Use the **sidebar** to check budget status and reset all data if needed.
- Connects to your FastAPI server deployed on **Render**.

### ✅ **NLP & Auto Categorization**

- Example: enter “Rapido” → it’s recognized as _Transportation_ using simple NLP matching.
- These mappings can be easily expanded to handle real-world use cases.

## ⚡ **How to Try It**

1. Open the **frontend app** → [Expense Buddy UI](https://expense-buddy-frontend.onrender.com)
2. Set your budget, log expenses, and see your weekly overview.
3. Click **Export CSV** to download your expense log.
4. Reset your data anytime with the sidebar reset button.
5. All actions talk directly to the **FastAPI server** → [Backend Server](https://expense-buddy-mcp-server.onrender.com)

## ✅ **Note on Data Persistence**

This project uses a simple **separate JSON files for each user based on their User ID's entered in the Sidebar** — this keeps the MCP concept clear and easy to understand.
For production, each user’s data would be stored separately in a proper database (e.g., SQLite, Firebase) to provide user isolation and efficient query.
